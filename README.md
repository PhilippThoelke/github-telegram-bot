# GitHub Telegram Bot
A bot for the instant messenger Telegram which can be used to remotely download, update and run GitHub repositories on the bot's host machine.

## Installation
Clone this repository on the target machine (server). Then run the config_generator.py once with the flag -p and specify a password which will be used to restrict access to the bot to people who know this password. Run the file again, this time with the -c flag and specify your GitHub username/email and password. The credentials will solely be stored on the machine where the repository was cloned and will only be used to retrieve the cloning URLs of the GitHub repositories belonging to the given user. Finally, run config_generator.py again with the -t flag and pass the Telegram bot token. Bot tokens can be generated by searching for the @BotFather bot in the Telegram messenger and creating a new bot. To start the bot, run the telegram_bot.py file. To handle reboots you can add this file to the server's autostarts.

## Usage
Once everything is set up and the telegram_bot.py script is running, the bot can be accessed via Telegram. The bot can be found by searching for the name that was specified via the @BotFather bot. Texting the command /help to the bot will list all available commands.

## Requirements
The required python modules are:
- PyGitHub (https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)
- requests
